        <h1><strong><u>A little about Morty</u></strong></h1>

        <p>My name is <em>Morty</em>.<br>
            My pronouns are whatever you want to call me just don't be a jerk about it.<br>
            My goals for this class are to learn more about how to create and design websites and further my coding knowledge<br>
            I like most outdoor activities, hanging out with my friends, playing any type of game, and cooking/baking.<br>
